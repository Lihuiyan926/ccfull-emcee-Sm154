The first line:
     AP,ZP,AT,ZT
The second line:
     RP,IVIBROTP,RT,IVIBROTT
          (The radius parameter used in the coupling Hamiltonian)
           (IVIBROT: option for intrinsic degree of freedom 
                     = -1; no excitation (inert)
                     = 0 ; vibrational coupling
                     = 1 ; rotational coupling
                IVIBROTP: for projectile excitation
		IVIBROTT: for target excitation)
The third line:
     OMEGAT,BETAT,LAMBDAT,NPHONONT  (if IVIBROTT=0)
     E2T,BETA2T,BETA4T,NROTT        (if IVIBROTT=1)
          (Input for the target excitation)
	  (This line is irrelevant if IVIBROTT = -1.)
	  (NROT: the number of levels in the rotational band to be 
                 included (up to I^pi=2*NROTT+ states are included)
                 e.g. if NROTT=2, then 0+, 2+ and 4+ in the target 
                 are included.)
The 4th line: 
     OMEGAT2,BETAT2,LAMBDAT2,NPHONONT2
	  (Input for target phonon excitation; the second mode of 
           excitation. 
           For example, the first mode (LAMBDAT) may be a quadrupole 
           vib. and the second mode (LAMBDAT2) may be an octupole vib. 
           in the target nucleus.)
          (No second target phonon excitation if NPHONONT2=0
	           OMEGAT2, BETAT2, and LAMBDAT2 are irrelevant 
                   if NPHONONT2=0)
The 5th line:
     OMEGAP,BETAP,LAMBDAP,NPHONONP  (if IVIBROTP=0)
     E2P,BETA2P,BETA4P,NROTP        (if IVIBROTP=1)
          (Input for the projectile excitation)
	  (This line is irrelevant if IVIBROTP = -1.)
	  (NROT: the number of levels in the rotational band to be 
                 included (up to I^pi=2*NROTP+ states are included)
                 e.g. if NROTP=2, then 0+, 2+ and 4+ in the projectile 
                 are included.)
The 6th line:
     NTRANS,QTRANS,FTR
          (Input for pair transfer channel)
          (NTRANS is either 0 OR 1)
              No transfer ch. if NTRANS=0
        	       QTRANS and FTR are irrelevant if NTRANS=0)
          (Coupling form factor: 
               FTRANS(R)=FTR * d VN/ dR)

	  (Potential parameters)
The 8th line: 
     VW,RW,AW
	  (Parameters for the imaginary part of optical potential)
The 9th line: 
     VWS,RWS,AWS
	  (Parameters for the surface imaginary part of optical potential)
The 10th line:
     RC  (the Coulomb radius)
The 11th line:
     EMIN,EMAX,DE
The 12th line:
     LMAX
The 13th line:
     THMIN,THMAX,DTH
	  (theta_min, theta_max, and the step to plot the angular distribution,
           all in the unit degree and in the center of mass frame. 
           If theta_min = theta_max, the code provides an excitation function 
           at the fixed angle.)
The 14th line:
     RMAX,DR

The 15th line:
     RMIN,RCOUPCUT

     (In order to avoid a numerical instability, the code solves the c.c.
     equations from RMIN to RMAX. For the same reason, the off-diagonal
     components of the coupling potential are assumed to be zero for
     r < RCOUPCUT. These are justified under a strong absorption in
     the inner region.)
